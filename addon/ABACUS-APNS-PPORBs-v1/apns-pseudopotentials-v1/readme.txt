The pseudopotentials (PSPs) in this directory are
tested for its efficiency and precision on ABACUS-PW
code. The convergence thresholds for efficiency
tests are set to 
- 1e-3 eV/atom for Kohn-Sham energy,
- 0.1 kbar for lattice pressure
- 1e-2 eV for band structure
, the minimal-suggested kinetic energy cutoffs of 
planewave for expanding the wavefunction (ecutwfc) 
are, respectively:

of the practical system you are working on, before
any productive calculation.
